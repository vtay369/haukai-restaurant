            <div class="about">
                <p>Ben and Elle Mills are a couple from Bay of Plenty who opened Haukai Restaurant on October 13th,
                    2022. They are proud of their New Zealand heritage and culture and are passionate about showcasing
                    traditional Maori Kai, while also educating others about the richness of the country's history. The
                    restaurant's motto is to highlight Maori culture, with a particular emphasis on the ritualized
                    aspects of collecting and eating food related to the gods.</p>
                <p> The Maori people have a great deal of respect for the concept of tapu, which denotes something holy
                    or sacred. They take great care to ensure that food does not infringe upon it. To remove tapu from
                    the food, they still practice rituals today, such as saying a karakia to thank the gods, the place,
                    and the atua (guardians) who provided the food. Ben and Elle bless the food in their restaurant with
                    a karakia to honor Maori culture. </p>
                <p> Maori cuisine has not always been valued as it should have been, even in New Zealand. This
                    traditional cooking style relies on seasonal ingredients from the land and sea, but it has not been
                    widely used in modern restaurant kitchens. However, some chefs are now taking steps to change this
                    by elevating the culinary style to fine dining and educating people about the traditional cuisine.
                </p>
                <p> Ben and Elle share a common goal of promoting Maori culture and cuisine through their restaurant.
                    They want to encourage Kiwis to see Maori cuisine as their own and introduce it to people from other
                    cultures. They strongly believe that by doing so, they can help people embrace and appreciate Maori
                    culture. </p>
                <p> Ben and Elle have a deep appreciation for New Zealand's rich heritage, including its land and sea
                    bounty, and Maori culture. Despite this, they are acutely aware of the crisis-level endangerment of
                    many traditionally consumed species of seafood, such as bluefin tuna, whitebait, tarakihi, kina, and
                    tipa. As a result, their menu actively avoids at-risk species. They are passionate about sharing
                    their love for the country's food, community, and heritage with their guests. </p>
